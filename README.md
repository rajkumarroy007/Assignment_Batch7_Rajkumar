<b>Password.py script for below details</b>


<br />In DevOps, security is a crucial aspect, and ensuring strong passwords is essential. Create a Python script to check the password strength. 

●       Implement a Python function called check_password_strength that takes a password string as input.

●       The function should check the password against the following criteria:

○       Minimum length: The password should be at least 8 characters long.

○       Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.

○       Contains at least one digit (0-9).

○       Contains at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %).

●       The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the password meets the criteria.

●       Write a script that takes user input for a password and calls the check_password_strength function to validate it.

●       Provide appropriate feedback to the user based on the strength of the password.

<br /><b>CPU_Monitor.py Script for below details</b>

<br />As a DevOps engineer, it is crucial to monitor the health and performance of servers. Write a Python program to monitor the health of the CPU. Few pointers to be noted:

●       The program should continuously monitor the CPU usage of the local machine.

●       If the CPU usage exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80%), an alert message should be displayed.

●       The program should run indefinitely until interrupted.

●       The program should include appropriate error handling to handle exceptions that may arise during the monitoring process.

<br /><b>backup.py script for backup of crucial data</b>

<br />
Performing regular backups of important files is crucial:

●       Implement a Python script called backup.py that takes a source directory and a destination directory as command-line arguments.

●       The script should copy all files from the source directory to the destination directory.

●       Before copying, check if the destination directory already contains a file with the same name. If so, append a timestamp to the file name to ensure uniqueness.

●       Handle errors gracefully, such as when the source directory or destination directory does not exist.
